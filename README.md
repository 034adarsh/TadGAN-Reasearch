# 💰 Stock Market Manipulation using Deep Learning 📈

---

## Overview 👀

Welcome to the Stock Market Manipulation using Deep Learning research project! This project focuses on testing advanced deep learning models to detect and understand stock market manipulation. By leveraging the power of deep learning techniques, we aim to uncover suspicious trading patterns, identify market anomalies, and contribute to a fair and transparent financial ecosystem.

## Repository Structure 🏛️

- `main.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of deep learning models and the training pipeline.
- `data/`: Includes curated datasets for training and testing the models.
- `results/`: Stores the research findings, experimental results, and analysis reports.
- `assets/`: Houses supplementary materials, such as diagrams and visualizations.
- `loader/`: Contains TAnoGAN dataloader for tensorflow API.

## Getting Started 🚗

To get started with the research project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the `code/` directory for deep learning model implementations.
4. Access the `data/` directory to obtain curated datasets for training and evaluation.
6. Analyze the research findings and experimental results in the `results/` directory.
7. Utilize the supplementary materials in the `assets/` directory for better understanding of the research.
